<h1>Twilight (Stephanie Meyer)</h1>

<p>
Before I'm judged too harshly, I would like to state relevant deal I made with someone (whose identity I will protect to preserve their reputation): 
In exchange for them reading the Mistborn trilogy, which impressed the wife and editor of the deceased author of <i>The Wheel of Time</i> enough to ask Brandon Sanderson to complete arguably the most renowned high fantasy saga of all time, I have to read... the Twilight series.<br>
Sounds fair, right?<br>
Anyways, some background about Twilight:<br>
Bella Swan, 17, moves from Phoenix, AZ, where she lived with her mom to the dreary forest town of Forks, WA to live with her dopey dad.
She starts high school and immediately is attracted to a creepy dude who grits his teeth and balls his fists in rage when she sits next to him in Biology but that's ok because he has "the face of Adonis", big pecs and looks like a model. 
This is Edward Cullen, who is actually a mind-reading vampire.
Well, the only person whose mind he can't read is Bella, who is also the best-smelling human he's ever encountered.
(Kind of a fishy coincidence but ok.)
