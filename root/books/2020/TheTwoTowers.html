<h1>The Two Towers (J. R. R. Tolkien)</h1>

<p>
The Two Towers is divided into two parts, like The Fellowship of the Ring. 
However, these parts are starkly different (as opposed to TFOTR) on account of the main characters being in different locations.
Part 1 of TTT consists of the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, and Merry and Pippin.
Months later, what stuck with me the most from Part 1 are the ancient Ents. Merry and Pippin encounter these unique creatures in Fangorn Forest after their escape from the Uruk Hai. 
Ents are enormous, humanoid tree people. They are slow, yet deliberate and act as shephards of the forest. 
Their existence is known to very few (save the wizards and elves), for while their domain (the forest) continues to shrink,
few travel far enough into its midsts to find an ent.
I believe even fewer would return to tell the tale. Every ent is very old, and is male, as the female ents (the entwives) left the ents thousands of years ago to tend to smaller plants and gardens.
It is likely, though not certain, that the entwives perished along with their gardens during the War of the Last Alliance in the Second Age. 
Because of this, there has not been a new ent (an enting) for a very long time, and it is likely that the ents, though extremely long-lived, will eventually become extint.
As the ents march against Isengard, Treebeard, the eldest of the remaining ents, speaks to Merry and Pippin.
It is my favorite quote in the The Two Towers:<br>
'Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he [Treebeard] said slowly, 'likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents.
But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now.
It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the Ents may be worth a song. Aye,' he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples before we pass away.
Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true about the Entwives.
I should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But there, my friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.'<br><br>
Most of the ents survived this assault. I hope one day they find their entwives.<br>

Part 2 of TTT consists of the adventures of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum.

Part 2 of TTT is considered the worst of the 6 parts of the series, but I disagree.
The second half of the book consists of Frodo and Sam slogging through the wilderness towards Mordor with Gollum as their guide.
It's fair to call the majority of this journey tedious, as a large fraction of it just traveling. 
But I think Tolkien does an excellent job of making this not merely bearable, but enjoyable. 
We are painted a vivid picture of their glacial pace through the rocky terrain of Emyn Muil, so much so that out of the entire series one of my clearest memories is of Frodo and Sam manuevering down steep cliffs and making use of the Lothlorien rope. 
I loved the section with Faramir, and his ability to withstand the temptation of the ring. 
This is a stark contrast with his brother Boromir, who was unable to resist its call, which indirectly cost him his life.
