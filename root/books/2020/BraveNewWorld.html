<h1>Brave New World (Aldous Huxley)</h1>

<p>
My sister gave me this book a few years back, and I finally got around to it this year. Out of the 20 (edit number later) books I read in 2020, it's the only one I read in a literal sense-- the rest I listened to. Thanks, sis.<br><br>

Brave New World is a dystopian novel set in our own future in the year 632 "After Ford" (or 2540 A.D., if you like).
Why is it dystopian? Well, people are bred into a genetic caste system. They are: <br>
Alphas: the highest tier: strongest, most intelligent, bred to be leaders of factories and societies. 
Their jobs require the most thinking.<br>
Betas: the tier below Alphas. They are bred to not be quite as intelligent as Alphas, though enjoy a similar standard of life in society.
Their jobs are typically a little less demanding than those of Alphas, such as a nurse.<br>
Gammas: below the Betas, Gammas usually specialized in less demanding jobs that still require modest intellect, such as working as a butler.<br>
Deltas: nearly the bottom tier of society, and more physically and mentally handicapped than Gammas.
Deltas work in highly repetitive jobs, such as factories.<br>
Epsilons: the most severely handicapped caste of all, Epsilon jobs are the most menial, but certainly not the least necessary. An Epsilon might be a lift operator or sewage worker.<br><br>

Artificially handicapping embryos and human breeding sounds pretty awful to the average reader, but the members of this society, Alpha to Epsilon, are for the most part happy.
Well, as happy as the lethargic mind of an Epsilon can be. How can this be?<br>
The answer is meticulous conditioning from birth. One example of this that stood out to me was a scene of a Delta nursery.
Young students watch as a crowd of delta babies are released into a room filled with books and flowers. 
The babies eagerly crawl to the items in pleasure.<br>
Then an alarm shrills, and the babies are electrically shocked.<br>
When nurses offer them books and flowers again, they shy away in fear. 200 repetitions later, the Delta babies are branded with an instinctive hatred of these things for reasons that, even if they weren't mentally handicapped, they probably wouldn't remember.<br><br>
Conditioning the conscious mind is powerful. But alone, it is terribly inefficient. All brains, big or small, need to rest. Fortunately, an ingenius technique was developed to not only overcome, but capitalize upon this "setback":<br>
<b>hypnopaedia</b>: the process of learning while sleeping.<br>
While complex rules of society or job-related skills cannot be trained during sleep, simplistic moral rules can. While a youth sleeps, memorable phrases are repeated over and over again. For a beta, it might be: "I'm awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't have to work so hard. For an alpha, it might be: "
