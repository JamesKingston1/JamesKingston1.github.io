<h1>Mistborn: The Final Empire (Brandon Sanderson)</h1>

<p>
Before I say anything about the series itself, I want to applaud GraphicAudio's audiobook cover of the Mistborn trilogy.
I have listened to ~20 audiobooks this year, and it is unparalleled in quality. 
Every character has a recognizable, unique voice, the sound effects put you in the middle of a scene, and the occasional, quiet background music hits just right.
In fact, the themes that play were composed specifically for this trilogy. 
You can access the audiobooks for free (for now) on Youtube at <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yGj_sqdFXM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yGj_sqdFXM</a>.<br><br>

The Final Empire is the first of a fantasy trilogy. The premise is a twist on the trope of a hero coming to save the world.
What if instead, the hero failed and the world fell to darkness? 
This hero, who was supposed to wield an extraordinary power for good, ended up taking it for himself to conquer the world.
This conquerer became the Lord Ruler, who in his mysterious rise to power gained immortality and established an empire to last the ages: The Final Empire.
Over a thousand years the Lord Ruler destroyed the practice (and almost the living memory) of every existing religion and formed his own, where he was worshipped as God: "A sliver of infinity". 
1,000 years later, the working class, or Skaa, are for the most part slaves to the ruling class, which are the Nobility.<br> 
Not all Skaa, however, are subservient to the nobility. 
A minority live outside the structure of this binary caste system.
Underground Skaa thieving crews settled in hideouts and dens, primarily concentrated in the Lord Ruler's home and capital, Luthadel. 
Even more rare than the thieving crews are Skaa rebels, groups working under the radar to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the Lord Ruler.
Over the millenia, Skaa rebellions have come and went. They were always meager and pathetic compared to the might of the Final Empire. 
This weakness was prominent in many ways. Almost every Skaa lived a life of abject poverty. They had no money or resources to build a decent army. 
The Skaa have been oppressed for a thousand years, so few could be persuaded to join what surely would be a pointless rebellion.<br><br>
But the power disparity between Nobility and Skaa does not end there-- anything
