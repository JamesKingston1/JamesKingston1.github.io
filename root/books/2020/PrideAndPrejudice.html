<h1>Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen)</h1>

<p>
Growing up with two women had me well-aquainted with Jane Austin films: Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and so on.
I hated them all, just as the standard young boy thought any young boy should. Teacups, parties and doilies. What's all the fuss?<br><br>

Fast-forward 15 years and one Jane Austin book later, and I think I get it.
It's certainly true that Pride and Prejudice is wrought with the plights of 19th century ladies, but something that elluded me until a few chapters in was the ample satire about all the things I hated as a boy.
Take Mr. Collins, the distant cousin of the protagonist's (Elizabeth Bennett) father.
He's a pompous and self-righteous social climber who is rejected by Elizabeth. 
Or Mrs. Bennett, described as a woman of "mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper". 
Her goal in life is to marry off her five daughters, and unsuccessful ventures in this regard are considered a personal failure. 
She gossips much and knows little. She can't see why Elizabeth shouldn't marry the conceited Mr. Collins. 
And that's why she's so funny. There are other characters that are satirically pompous or conceited (Lady Katherine, for instance), they're the best parts of the books, and Austen knows it. I'm glad I finally know it too.<br><br>

I wasn't particularly invested in the romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, and I don't think I was expected to be. 
Their misplaced confidence in their own judgement and poor understanding for the other (their pride and prejudice, you might say) was amusing, but to me their conflicts weren't nearly as entertaining as her sisters' romantic escapades, which between them include:<br>
- Flirting with visiting soldiers<br>
- Running away with the sleezy Mr. Wickham<br>
- Ratting each other out<br>
- The most drawn-out courting of all time (looking at you, Mr. Bingley-- even with your sisters and Mr. Darcy plotting against your interest in Jane, you could have proposed to her ages ago if you weren't so clueless)<br><br>

<u>Should you read it?</u><br>
If you were like me and harbored a (pride and) prejudice against Jane Austen books and want to see how they became so popular, look no further than Pride and Prejudice.
Edit: Or look a little further and pick up Emma, which is significantly funnier and actually has a memorable protagonist.
