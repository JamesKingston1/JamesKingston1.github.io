<h1>Setting up a Computing Environment</h1>

<p>
These are a list of instructions for setting up a basic computing environment for a Macbook Pro.<br>
These instructions are written for OS X Big Sur 11.2.3 with a zsh shell.<br>
</p>

<p>
To install basic the basic Command Line Tools package, run:<br><br>
<code>
xcode-select --install
</code><br><br>
Next, let's install Homebrew. Homebrew is an open-source package management system that simplifies the installation of software on macOS (and Linux):<br><br>
<code>
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
</code><br><br>

If you try to run the above with /bin/zsh you get "Bash is required to interpret this script."<br>
Next, we will install Anaconda, a distribution of Python for scientific computing that simplifies package management and deployment.<br><br>
I find it easiest to do the graphical installation. Go to <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads"></a>
and download the 64-Bit Graphical Installer for MacOS. Open the packages and follow the instructions, they are pretty straightforward.<br><br>
With Anaconda installed you can now open a Jupyter Notebook. To do this, run:<br><br>
<code>
Jupyter Notebook [file]
</code><br><br>
