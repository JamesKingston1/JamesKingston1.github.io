<h1>Powerlifting Progress</h1>

<p>
<u>August 2020 Maxes</u><br>
Bench: 225 <br>
Squat: 275 <br>
Deadlift: 315 <br>

<u>September 2020 - November 2020</u><br>
Suffered injury in left hip and both knees, slow recovery coupled with multiple moves and schoolwork halted progress. 
Set up a personal gym (squat rack and bench: the basics) in a public storage unit in Lubbock, TX. Simplistic, but nice.
<u>December 2020</u><br>
Finally resumed the 3 basic lifts again, but am going light. Finally able to do the full motion of deadlift without left hippopping.
Left hip pops softly when I hit squat depth, but it's not bad. No issues with bench, fortunately.<br>
I am doing barbell calf raises with weight ranging between 135 and 185, depending on how long I stick it at the top.
I do the calf-raises on 25 plates to get a deeper range of motion. <br>
End of month status:<br>
Bench: <br>
Squat: <br>
Deadlift: <br>
