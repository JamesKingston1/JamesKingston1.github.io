<h1>Planche Progress (Pictures/Videos to Come)</h1>

<p>
Starting in February of 2020 I began training the planche. Goal is to get a full planche by the end of 2021.<br><br>

<u>February - June</u><br>
Increased tuck planche from 12 seconds to 40 seconds<br>
<u>July - June</u><br>
Progressed to 5 seconds of advanced tuck planche<br>
<u>August - December</u><br>
Training straddle planche leans. Can get up to 5 seconds with highly curved back<br><br>

<u>Mid December Update</u><br>
I haven't seen significant improvement in the past months. I think training planche leans exclusively isn't cutting it. 
I am going to start including more supplementary training, including tuck planche, advanced tuck planche, handstand pushups, etc. <br>
