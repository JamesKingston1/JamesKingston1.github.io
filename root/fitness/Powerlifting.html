<u>August 2020 Maxes</u><br>
Bench: 225 <br>
Squat: 275 <br>
Deadlift: 315 <br>

<u>September 2020 - November 2020</u><br>
Suffered injury in left hip and both knees, slow recovery coupled with multiple moves and schoolwork halted progress. 
Set up a personal gym (squat rack and bench: the basics) in a public storage unit in Lubbock, TX. Simplistic, but nice.<br>
<u>December 2020</u><br>
Finally resumed the 3 basic lifts again, but am going light. Finally able to do the full motion of deadlift without left hip popping.
Left hip pops softly when I hit squat depth, but it's not bad. No issues with bench.<br>
I am doing barbell calf raises with weight ranging between 135 and 185, depending on how long I stick it at the top.
I do the calf-raises on 25 plates to get a deeper range of motion. <br>

Deadlift (sumo): Completed Week 15 of Program: 3x1 @95% (300) (PR); Felt very difficult, mainly on grip.

<u>September 11th 2021</u><br>
Maxed out all three lifts on this day. First time attempting a "mock meet", where each lift gets three attempts.<br>
S: Success <br>
F: Failure <br>
Squat: 275 (S), 300 (S) (PR), 315 (F)<br>
Bench: 225 (S), 240 (S) (PR), 250 (S) (PR)<br>
Deadlift (sumo): 300 (S), 315 (S) (PR), 335 (S) (PR)<br>
Lift Success: 8/9<br>
Overall Total: 885<br>
Review: Disappointed in the 315 fail, but very happy with the 250 and 335 lifts. My 250 bench was very clean and the 335
deadlift felt good as well: for that I used chalk, which I believe helped my grip.<br>
My next lifting goals are a 315 squat and a 900 total. I guess the first implies the second, but not vice-versa.<br><br>

<u>Moving Forward</u><br>
I am going to shift away from self-programming for now and attempt to follow the Candito 6 week Program.<br>
