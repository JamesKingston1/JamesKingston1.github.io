<h1>Test of an update</h1>

<p>
My name is James Kingston. I am an incoming physics PhD student at UC Davis.<br><br>

I'm interested in direct detection of dark matter, and am working in the <a href="http://pantic.physics.ucdavis.edu">Pantic Group</a> on the DarkSide-20k experiment.<br><br>

There isn't much to see yet, but stay tuned for research updates, publications, and more :) <br><br>
